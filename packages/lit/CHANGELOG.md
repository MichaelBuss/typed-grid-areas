### Patch Changes

- [`63db22d`](https://github.com/MichaelBuss/typed-grid-areas/commit/63db22d3cfffcd59025461e86a8d79bd56d7673d) Thanks [@man-trackunit](https://github.com/man-trackunit)! - The npm page links to the docs site, which explains how layouts are derived and lets you try the library in your browser: the package's homepage is now https://michaelbuss.github.io/typed-grid-areas/, and the README opens with links to the docs and the Try it page. Every link in the README works on npm, and the package is easier to find by searching for CSS grid layouts and your framework. The code is unchanged.

- [#51](https://github.com/MichaelBuss/typed-grid-areas/pull/51) [`cb8e633`](https://github.com/MichaelBuss/typed-grid-areas/commit/cb8e6336f59fdd3def054ac0b7586c622c01fcd9) Thanks [@MichaelBuss](https://github.com/MichaelBuss)! - Production builds no longer include the development-only checks. The config validation `defineLayout` runs and each grid's slot check, with their warning messages, are now dropped when your bundler (such as Vite or esbuild) builds for production, so they cost nothing in your app's bundle. In development they warn as before, and importing the library without a bundler, where `process` doesn't exist, still works and logs nothing.

### Minor Changes

- [#38](https://github.com/MichaelBuss/typed-grid-areas/pull/38) [`f191dd2`](https://github.com/MichaelBuss/typed-grid-areas/commit/f191dd21f8583af3061f7e5740989cb721edc329) Thanks [@MichaelBuss](https://github.com/MichaelBuss)! - Render grids in Lit 3: `npm i typed-grid-areas @typed-grid-areas/lit`, then `createGrid(definition)` gives a template function per definition. `Card(content, { class, style, ref })` renders the grid in light DOM, and `Card.icon` is the area's name typed as a literal, so `data-area=${Card.icon}` makes any element its slot and a misspelled area is a type error. `nest` reaches a nested grid's areas through its area (`Card.content.icon`). Each definition's CSS is adopted once into the shadow root a grid renders in (or put in `<head>` in the document); `gridStyles(Card)` in `static styles` carries it into `@lit-labs/ssr`'s declarative shadow roots for server rendering and hydration. In development, a missing required slot or a stray direct child warns on the console.
