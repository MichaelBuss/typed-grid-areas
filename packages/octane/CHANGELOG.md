# @typed-grid-areas/octane

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [`63db22d`](https://github.com/MichaelBuss/typed-grid-areas/commit/63db22d3cfffcd59025461e86a8d79bd56d7673d) Thanks [@man-trackunit](https://github.com/man-trackunit)! - The npm page links to the docs site, which explains how layouts are derived and lets you try the library in your browser: the package's homepage is now https://michaelbuss.github.io/typed-grid-areas/, and the README opens with links to the docs and the Try it page. Every link in the README works on npm, and the package is easier to find by searching for CSS grid layouts and your framework. The code is unchanged.

- [#51](https://github.com/MichaelBuss/typed-grid-areas/pull/51) [`cb8e633`](https://github.com/MichaelBuss/typed-grid-areas/commit/cb8e6336f59fdd3def054ac0b7586c622c01fcd9) Thanks [@MichaelBuss](https://github.com/MichaelBuss)! - Production builds no longer include the development-only checks. The config validation `defineLayout` runs and each grid's slot check, with their warning messages, are now dropped when your bundler (such as Vite or esbuild) builds for production, so they cost nothing in your app's bundle. In development they warn as before, and importing the library without a bundler, where `process` doesn't exist, still works and logs nothing.

### Minor Changes

- [#38](https://github.com/MichaelBuss/typed-grid-areas/pull/38) [`51dbfb5`](https://github.com/MichaelBuss/typed-grid-areas/commit/51dbfb5b68ee288b8c9267feac65ea969e987f68) Thanks [@MichaelBuss](https://github.com/MichaelBuss)! - An experimental Octane adapter: `npm i typed-grid-areas @typed-grid-areas/octane`, then `import { createGridComponent } from "@typed-grid-areas/octane"`. The React adapter's API, natively in Octane: a component per definition, a slot component per area (member tags work in `.tsx` and `.tsrx`, including inside `@if`), `nest`, and the development warnings. Make your own element the slot, or the grid, with `render={<el />}`. Each definition's CSS goes on the page once through Octane's `injectStyle`; with server rendering it arrives in `renderToString`'s `css` (put it before your markup) and leads a stream's shell. Ships as source for your app's Octane bundler plugin to compile. Supports Octane 0.16 only; experimental until Octane 1.0.
